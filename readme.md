OurHouse LightHouse
==

LightHouse is the local connector for the OurHouse app from Knoyle Technologies. LightHouse extends the functionality of the app by enabling the option of the "Who's In" function.

### Who's In
The Who's in function works by retrieving a list of devices from Knoyle Technologies Data Services of users who have opted in to Who's in. LightHouse will then attempt to ping each device and then report the status back to Data Services and show on the user's app.

### Camera Connect
The Camera connect function is a planned function that will connect in-house camera feeds to be accessed over through the OurHouse app.
